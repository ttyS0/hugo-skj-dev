title = "what is this site for anyway?"

Since forever ago I’ve thought a single site that collected technical, and not so technical content was the way to go. It’s taken me forever-1 to realize that approach doesn’t work for me. As a result I’m trying a different approach. This site is where all my technology related writings will go. For other genres such as entertainment and random opinion, I have [108 Minutes](https://108minutes.net). I suspect there may be some blurring of lines from time to time, but if that happens it means I’m actually writing posts on a regular basis so I will consider it a win.


While this site will be for writings of a technical nature, it is not a place for procedures. That content I’m putting in a site adjacent wiki over at [skj.wiki](https://skj.wiki).
